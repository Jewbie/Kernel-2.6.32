Configure the Build

Retrieve a working kernel config from the device, and unzip it:

    adb pull /proc/config.gz /home/user_name/android/kernel/config.gz 
    cat config.gz | gunzip > .config 

Alternatively, you can pull the .config from the newest boot.img

    scripts/extract-ikconfig boot.img > .config 

Configure the build. Just enter to accept defaults, or customize as needed:

    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=$CCOMPILER oldconfig 
    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=$CCOMPILER menuconfig 

Make the build

    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=$CCOMPILER -j`grep 'processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`

        This step may take a while, depending on your computer. 

At this point you should have a kernel stored in ~/android/kernel/arch/arm/boot/zImage and kernel modules, if any were built, in the module sub-directories.
